# Negative Space

This is my addition of the space invader tutorial we got.
After clicking play on the menu screen the game will begin.

# Win Condition
The goal of the game is to reduce the boss's health, which is displayed in the top right corner,
to zero. 

# Game Over
The boss is protected by many aliens that not only go back and forth, but will advance towards you each time they reach the sides.
On top of that you will notice that as your score increases the aliens' speed will increase as well.

# How to Play
The controls are simple. Use the left arrow to go left, use the right arrow to go right, and use the up arrow to fire your laser.
