At the beginning of this project I was very apprehensive about how much I would enjoy this. I was always clear when I was telling people what my major was that I was not interested in creating/designing video games. I suppose when I look back on that thought process now it seems silly because I was going against something that I liked because I didn't want to come off as immature. That being said, when I finally got down into working on this I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself having a lot of fun understanding how to do this kind of coding. There is a lot of work that has to go into coding a game and I only got a taste of a more simpler end of it, not to mention when I looked a little deeper into what people have been able to do with pygame I was very inspired to see how much dedication people to creating these works of art. Now I did not encounter a large problem while doing this as we were given a tutorial to work with, I will say though that the part that cause me the most problems was getting the menu to function properly. This can tie into something that I would also have told myself to look out for at the start of this and that would be to have all the game related stuff located inside of a function that way when I am getting the menu to properly switch to it I won't have as many problems. One other issue I had was with the laser not moving from the ship once the menu was set up, after getting a nudge in the right direction from my professor I was able to figure out what exactly was causing the issue and that actually felt kind of rewarding to figure out what the bug was. I definitely do intend to keep up with this game and hopefully other pygame things, as well as being able to say that this project taught me some good concepts about basic game coding as well as problem solving. I look forward to being able to show this as a representation of that.
